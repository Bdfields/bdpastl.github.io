# Javascript Homework 2! 



### 1. Arrays

Create an array `var avengers` and store the strings `Captain America`, `Iron Man`, `Thor`, `Black Widow`, `Hulk`, `Hawk Eye`,  `War Machine`, `Falcon`, `Black Panther`, `Scarlet Witch`, `Vision`, and `Spiderman`: 

- Print out each of the avengers invidually with a `console.log`. Access them with their numerical value 
  - e.g. the very first console.log should be `console.log(avengers[0])`
- Create a `for` loop, and loop over the array. For the condition, use `avengers.length` to see how long the string is. Print the avengers inside of the for loop. 
  - i.e. the only code inside your loop should be `console.log(avengers[i])` 
- Convert your `for` loop from the previous portion into a while loop. (You should only need to change the type of loop, and two extra lines of code). 



### 2. Objects 

Create a variable `myObject` and store in it: 

- Create a second string `coolness` and assign it the value ` is cool`. Create a third scring `sentence` and assign it the value `myName + coolness`. Print the output to the console.
