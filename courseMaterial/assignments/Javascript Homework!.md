# Javascript Homework! 



### 1. Maths! 

Create two variables `a` and `b`. Assign `a = 7`, `b = 13`. Do the following: 

- Assign a new variable `c` to the sum of `a + b + b`. Print the output to the console. 
- Assign a new variable `d` to the product of `a * b`. Print the output to the console. 
- Assign a new variable `e` to the the quotient of `a / b`. Print the output to the console. 
- Assign a new variable `f` to the reminder of `b % a`. Print the output to the console.

### 2. Strings! 

Create a variable `myName` and assign your name to it. 

- Create a second string `coolness` and assign it the value ` is cool`. Create a third scring `sentence` and assign it the value `myName + coolness`. Print the output to the console. 

### Booleans! 

Create two variables `T` and `F` and assign them the values of `true` and `false`. 

- Create a variable called `trueAndTrue` and assign it the value: `T && T` and print it to the console.
- Create a variable called `trueAndFalse` and assign it the value: `T && F` and print it to the console.
- Create a variable called `falseAndTrue` and assign it the value: `F && T` and print it to the console.
- Create a variable called `falseAndFalse` and assign it the value: `F && F` and print it to the console.
- Create a variable called `trueOrTrue` and assign it the value of `T || T` and print it to the console.
- Create a variable called `trueOrFalse` and assign it the value of `T || F` and print it to the console.
- Create a variable called `falseOrTrue` and assign it the value of `F || T` and print it to the console.
- Create a variable called `falseOrFalse `and assign it the value of `F || F` and print it to the console.

### Conditionals! 

Create the variables `one`, `two`, `three`. In each of them store `1`, `,2`, and `3` (so their names match their value). 

- Create an if statment that checks whether or not `three` is greater than `two`. Inside the if statement, print 'Three is greater than two' to the console. 
- Create an if statement that checks whether or not `two` is greater than `three`.  After the if statmeent, create an `else` that prints 'Two is not greater than three!'. 
- Create an if statement that checks whether `one` is equal to `two`, after that, create an `else if` statement that checks to see if `one` is equal to `one`. Inside of that, create an `else`.  Inside of each, write console.logs to print what the conditionals say. 

### Loops! 

Create a while loop that has a variable named `counter` in it (i.e. a variable that increments with theloop). In the loop, print the value of `counter`.  Make the condition of the `while` loop `counter < 20`. 



### Fizz Buzz! 

Copy the above loop code. In your loop, use if / else to print `fizz` if the number is divisible by `3`, print `buzz` if the number is divisible by `5`, and print `fizzbuzz` if the number is divisible by both `3` and `5`.  

To find whether or not something is divisible by another number, such as `3`, the easies method is to check if `numberToCheck % 3 == 0`, that is to say `3%3 == 0`, `6%3 == 0` etc. because when `3`, `6` and any other number divisible by `3` is divided by `3`, there is no remaineder.
