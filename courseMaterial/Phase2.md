# Phase II

For the coming weeks, the plan is to start up on building working front and backend sites from scratch. The teams are: 



| Team 1  | Team 2 |
| ------- | ------ |
| Andy    | Delano |
| Deshawn | Jacob  |
| Jason   | Kalina |
| Layden  | Malina |
| Zoe     | Ritam  |
|         | Sriram |



### Goals: 

Work as a team.

Manage time on site functions (you may need someone to work as a project manager). 

Work independently (i.e. the mentors are around for questioning, but we will not be guiding you)





### Site Requirements: 

1. Backend database (at least two tables. One for site material, another for login data). 
3. Frontend that is responsive to user queries. 
3. Site must have 2 views
        a. **Student** view, where students can see, and interact with available quiz(zes)
        b. **Teacher** view, where teachers can **create**, **update**, and **destroy** quizzes
4. Site must have **authentication**.
5. Site must use bootstrap on frontend.
6. Site must have persistence for quizzes, where the ‘create/read/update/destroy’ operations interact with **quiz materials**  AND **user information** in database.



### Site Showcase: 

During the week prior to the competition, we will display all of our sites. You have one month to complete as much as you can as a team. During the showcase, the teams will: 

- Discuss:
  - The problem you were trying to solve (i.e. this prompt)
  - How you were able to work as a team to achieve this goal (i.e. who worked on what)
  - Technologies you've used. 
  - Bariers you've overcome. 
- Demo: 
  - A working website.
